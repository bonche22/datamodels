## HBase

HBase is an open-source NoSQL column-family database management system developed by the Apache Software Foundation. Its website is <https://hbase.apache.org/>. HBase is primarily an open-source software product, available under the Apache License. However, several commercial distributions of HBase are available, such as Cloudera CDH, Hortonworks HDP, and MapR Converged Data Platform. HBase uses a column-family data model, where data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. It supports flexible schema design, where each row can have a different set of columns, and it is optimized for write-heavy workloads. HBase is primarily a server-based database system, designed to be deployed on a distributed cluster of machines. It is built on top of Apache Hadoop, which provides a distributed filesystem (HDFS) and a distributed computing framework (MapReduce), and it uses Apache ZooKeeper for coordination and synchronization between nodes. Both Java and Python can access HBase databases using specialized drivers and libraries. HBase provides official drivers for Java and Python, as well as other programming languages. Additionally, there are many third-party libraries available for Java and Python that provide convenient abstractions and interfaces for working with HBase.
