## MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database management system developed by MongoDB Inc. Its website is <https://www.mongodb.com/>. MongoDB is primarily an open-source software product, with a community edition available under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). However, MongoDB Inc. also offers a commercial version called MongoDB Enterprise, which includes additional features and support. MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored as JSON-like documents consisting of key-value pairs. It does not use tables or other relational database objects, but it supports rich query and indexing capabilities. MongoDB supports multiple hosting models, including on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid cloud deployments. It can be installed on various operating systems and platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. Both Java and Python can access MongoDB databases using specialized drivers and libraries. MongoDB provides official drivers for Java and Python, as well as other programming languages. Additionally, there are many third-party libraries available for Java and Python that provide convenient abstractions and interfaces for working with MongoDB.
