## Extra Credit: Gremlin

Gremlin is an open-source graph database that is designed to store and process large-scale graphs. Its website is <https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html>. Gremlin is primarily an open-source software product, available under the Apache License. However, several commercial distributions of Gremlin are available, such as JanusGraph and Amazon Neptune. Gremlin is based on the property graph data model, which is a graph-based data model that consists of nodes, edges, and properties. Nodes represent entities in the graph, edges represent relationships between entities, and properties represent attributes of entities or relationships. Both nodes and edges can have properties associated with them, and both can be labeled or categorized to allow for more efficient querying. Gremlin is primarily a server-based database system, designed to be deployed on a distributed cluster of machines. It uses Apache TinkerPop, a graph computing framework, to provide a standard interface for interacting with graph databases. Gremlin supports multiple storage backends, such as Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and RocksDB, and it can be deployed on various cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Both Java and Python can access Gremlin databases using specialized drivers and libraries. Gremlin provides official drivers for Java and Python, as well as other programming languages. Additionally, there are many third-party libraries available for Java and Python that provide convenient abstractions and interfaces for working with Gremlin.

#### How the Gremlin data model is different from others:

The Gremlin data model is different from the data models we've discussed earlier in that it is a graph-based data model, whereas the others were document-oriented, column-family, or relational. In a graph database like Gremlin, data is represented as nodes and edges, which can have properties associated with them. This allows for more expressive modeling of relationships between data points, making it well-suited for use cases like social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. The query language for Gremlin is also designed to work with graph-based data, allowing for complex graph traversals and pattern matching.
