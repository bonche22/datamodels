## MariaDB

MariaDB is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) and a community-driven fork of MySQL. Its website is <https://mariadb.org/>. MariaDB is primarily an open-source software product, with a community edition available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). However, MariaDB Corporation, the company behind MariaDB, also offers a commercial version called MariaDB Enterprise. MariaDB uses a relational data model, similar to MySQL and other RDBMSs, where data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. It also supports various database objects such as views, stored procedures, triggers, and events. MariaDB supports multiple hosting models, including on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid cloud deployments. It can be installed on various operating systems and platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. Both Java and Python can access MariaDB databases using JDBC and ODBC drivers. MariaDB also provides specialized connectors for Java and Python, which offer improved performance and compatibility. Additionally, Python users can use third-party libraries like PyMySQL and mariadb-connector-python to interact with MariaDB databases.
