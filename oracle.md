## Oracle

Oracle is a relational database management system developed by Oracle Corporation. Its website is <https://www.oracle.com/database/>. Oracle is a commercial software product. However, Oracle also offers a free, community-supported version called Oracle Database Express Edition (XE). Oracle uses a relational data model, similar to SQL Server, where data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. It also supports various database objects such as indexes, views, stored procedures, triggers, and sequences. Oracle supports multiple hosting models, including on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid cloud deployments. It can be installed on various operating systems and platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. Both Java and Python can access Oracle databases using JDBC and ODBC drivers. Oracle also provides specialized drivers for Java and Python. In addition, Python users can use third-party libraries like cx_Oracle to interact with Oracle databases.
