## MySQL

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation. Its website is <https://www.mysql.com/>. MySQL is primarily an open-source software product, with a community edition available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). However, Oracle also offers a commercial version called MySQL Enterprise Edition, which includes additional features and support. MySQL uses a relational data model, similar to SQL Server and Oracle, where data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. It also supports various database objects such as views, stored procedures, triggers, and events. MySQL supports multiple hosting models, including on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid cloud deployments. It can be installed on various operating systems and platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. Both Java and Python can access MySQL databases using JDBC and ODBC drivers. MySQL also provides specialized connectors for Java and Python, which offer improved performance and compatibility. Additionally, Python users can use third-party libraries like MySQL Connector/Python to interact with MySQL databases.
