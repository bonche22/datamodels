## CouchDB

CouchDB is an open-source NoSQL document-oriented database management system developed by the Apache Software Foundation. Its website is <https://couchdb.apache.org/>. CouchDB is primarily an open-source software product, available under the Apache License. However, Couchbase Inc., a company founded by the creators of CouchDB, offers a commercial version called Couchbase Server. CouchDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored as JSON-like documents consisting of key-value pairs. It does not use tables or other relational database objects, but it supports rich query and indexing capabilities, as well as built-in versioning and conflict resolution features. CouchDB is primarily a server-based database system, designed to be accessed over the network using HTTP(S) and RESTful APIs. However, it also supports local replication and offline-first applications through its built-in synchronization features. Both Java and Python can access CouchDB databases using specialized drivers and libraries. CouchDB provides official drivers for Java and Python, as well as other programming languages. Additionally, there are many third-party libraries available for Java and Python that provide convenient abstractions and interfaces for working with CouchDB.
