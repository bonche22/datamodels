## BerkeleyDB

BerkeleyDB is an open-source, embedded key-value database library developed by Oracle Corporation. Its website is <https://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/>. Open-source or commercial? BerkeleyDB is primarily an open-source software product, with a community edition available under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license. However, Oracle also offers a commercial version called Oracle BerkeleyDB. BerkeleyDB uses a key-value data model, where data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs. It does not support tables or other relational database objects, but it can be used to implement custom data structures and indexes. BerkeleyDB is primarily an embedded database library, which means that it is designed to be integrated directly into applications rather than being hosted as a separate service. However, BerkeleyDB also supports client/server deployments through its replication and high availability features. Java and Python both have libraries that allow them to access Berkeley DB databases. Java applications can use the Java Collections Framework API or specialized libraries like JEPLayer. Python applications can use the bsddb module in the standard library or third-party libraries like PyBSDDB.
