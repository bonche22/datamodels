## SQLServer

SQLServer is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. Its website is <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server>. SQLServer is a commercial software product. However, Microsoft also offers a free, stripped-down version called SQLServer Express. SQLServer uses a relational data model, which means that data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. It also supports the use of views, stored procedures, triggers, and other database objects. SQLServer supports multiple hosting models, including embedded, client/server, and cloud-based. It can be installed on-premises or hosted in the cloud through Microsoft Azure. Both Java and Python can access SQLServer using a variety of methods, including JDBC and ODBC for Java, and pyodbc and pyodbc-azure for Python. Microsoft also offers drivers and libraries specifically designed for integrating with SQLServer from these programming languages.
